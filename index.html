            <div class="article-text">
                <p>
                    Tabletop games are games that are normally played on a table or other flat surface, such as board
                    games,
                    card games, dice games, miniature war-games, or tile-based games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Games like chess and draughts are examples of games belonging to the board game category. Other
                    games,
                    however, use various attributes and cannot be classified unambiguously (e.g. Monopoly utilizes a
                    board
                    as well as dice and cards).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For several of these categories there are sub-categories and even sub-sub-categories or genres. For
                    instance, German-style board games, board war-games, and Roll-and-move games are all types of board
                    games
                    that differ markedly in style and general interest.

            <div class="article-text">
                <p>
                    A digital tabletop game is a video game genre that includes video games that have game play similar
                    to
                    physical tabletop games, including board games, card games, and role-playing games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many digital
                    tabletop games are adaptions of existing physical games into the video games, though some of these
                    are
                    wholly digital games that use tabletop game mechanics. There are also tabletop game simulators that
                    allow for users to recreate tabletop games from a variety of game pieces.
