# üé≤ **TABLETOP GAMERS** üÉè

## Project Overview

The aim behind this project is to demonstrate my skills in the following areas:

* Designing a frontend web application, based around the principles of user experience, design, accessibility. All while being responsive so that the design is represented well on any device used to access the site.

* Developing and implementing a static frontend web application using HTML & CSS.

* Maximizing future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organization.

* Usage of version control software to maintain, upload and share code with other developers.

* Testing and deploying a frontend web application to a cloud platform.

## Site Overview

The aim of this project is to create a website for a fictional venue to use as a platform to advertise their services, create single point of reference for upcoming events, display images/photos from previous events, and allow users to sign up to a newsletter.

The target audience is existing tabletop gamers, and newcomers showing an interest in Tabletop Games.

Tabletop games are games that are normally played on a table or other flat surface, such as board games, card games, dice games, miniature wargames, or tile-based games. [1]

Such games can also usually be played via a Virtual Tabletop (VTT) such as Tabletop Simulator, Fantasy Grounds or Roll20.

## Planning Stage

### Target Audience:
* Users that are already playing tabletop games, but are looking for a group to play and socialize with.
* Users that are new to tabletop games, looking to join a group of existing players.
* Users that have never heard of tabletop games previously.
* Users that have heard of tabletop games, but are looking for more information on the subject.


### Site Aims:
* Provide the user with some basic information on what tabletop games are, and include external links to free resources for further reading.
* Provide the user an option to sign up to a newsletter.
* Provide the user with a timeline of future events.
* Provide the user with a photo/image gallary for past events.
* Provide the user with a summary of services offered, and a location on where to join a group.

### Wireframes:
To organise and streamline the development process, I created wireframes for this project, to help prevent scope creep.

Below are links to each page of the project, created to cover both the Desktop and Mobile versions.
