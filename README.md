## Site Overview

The aim of this project is to create a website for a fictional venue to use as a platform to advertise their services, create single point of reference for upcoming events, display images/photos from previous events, and allow users to sign up to a newsletter.

The target audience is existing tabletop gamers, and newcomers showing an interest in Tabletop Games.

Tabletop games are games that are normally played on a table or other flat surface, such as board games, card games, dice games, miniature wargames, or tile-based games.[1]

Such games can also usually be played via a Virtual Tabletop (VTT).
