## Project Overview

The aim behind this project is to demonstrate my skills in the following areas:

* Designing a frontend web application, based around the principles of user experience, design, accessibility. All while being responsive so that the design is represented well on any device used to access the site.

* Developing and implementing a static frontend web application using HTML & CSS.

* Maximizing future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organization.

* Usage of version control software to maintain, upload and share code with other developers.

* Testing and deploying a frontend web application to a cloud platform.

## Site Overview

The aim of this project is to create a website for a fictional venue to use as a platform to advertise their services, create single point of reference for upcoming events, display images/photos from previous events, and allow users to sign up to a newsletter.

The target audience is existing tabletop gamers, and newcomers showing an interest in Tabletop Games.

Tabletop games are games that are normally played on a table or other flat surface, such as board games, card games, dice games, miniature wargames, or tile-based games. [1]

Such games can also usually be played via a Virtual Tabletop (VTT) such as [Tabletop Simulator](https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/), [Fantasy Grounds](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/) or [Roll20](https://roll20.net/).
